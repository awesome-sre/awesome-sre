# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request

To the best of my knowledge, no resource like this exists. The intent of this project is to create a highly curated list of high quality maintained tools and libraries for use in the development of Site Reliability Engineering teams and practices.

- List items should be sorted *alphabetically*.
- Each item should be limited to one link.
- The link should be the name of the package or project.
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line.
- Needs at least three sub items to create a new category.

Please contribute links to packages/projects/tools you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

## Quality Standard

- Code functions as documented and expected
- Generally useful to the wider SRE community
- Actively maintained
  - Regular, recent commits
  - Issues and pull requests are responded to
  - Support is available and responsive
- Stable for production use
- Thoroughly documented
- Well tested

## Reporting Issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource.

Thanks :-)
